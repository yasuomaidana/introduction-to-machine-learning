    "Below is the prompt template with placeholders for the conversation history and input. We'll try this out with `distilgpt2`. However it is a smaller model that will run quickly but not perform very well as a chatbot. In comparison, larger chat-specific language models (including ChatGPT) can adapt well to different inputs and have been trained specifically for conversations."
